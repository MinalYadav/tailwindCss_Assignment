            <p>One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of the book, I asked him again about his tendency
            to be rough on people. “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart people I work with, and any of them could 
            get a top job at another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they don’t.” Then he paused for a few moments 
            and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some amazing things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the 
            past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes 
            Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his 
            final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a 
            very loving wife, sister, and four children.</p>
